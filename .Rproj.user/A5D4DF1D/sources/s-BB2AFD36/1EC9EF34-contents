Braden Schrock is an active-duty Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy and is currently pursuing an MBA at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University as a Navy Fleet Scholar. Prior to Kellogg, Braden served as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officer. Over the course of four overseas deployments, he worked with militaries from over 11 different countries in missions ranging from teaching landmine clearance techniques in South Sudan to countering weapons of mass destruction with South Korean Navy SEALs.  He graduated cum laude with a degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan.  

Braden loves solving problems! As an EOD officer, he has to solve unique problems every day using both technology and creativity. Now, having immersed himself in the startup and venture capital world while at Kellogg, he's excited about bringing what he's learned to bear on innovation within the Navy.
