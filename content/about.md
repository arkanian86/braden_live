:wave:

I'm an active-duty Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy and  currently pursuing an MBA at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University as a Navy Fleet Scholar.

Prior to Kellogg, I served as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officer. Over the course of four overseas deployments, I worked with militaries from over 11 different countries in missions ranging from teaching landmine clearance techniques in South Sudan to countering weapons of mass destruction with South Korean Navy SEALs.  

I graduated cum laude with a degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan - go blue!

I love solving problems! As an EOD officer, I have to solve unique problems every day using both technology and creativity. Now, having immersed myself in the startup and venture capital world while at Kellogg, I'm excited about bringing what I've learned to bear on innovation within the Navy.
