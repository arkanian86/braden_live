<p>The United States Department of Defense (DoD) intends to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to both transform its business processes as well as the application of force on the battlefield. The last two presidents have directed the DoD to shift focus from counter-insurgency operations to <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2107397/near-peer-threats-at-highest-point-since-cold-war-dod-official-says/">near-peer competition</a>. DoD is investing in AI technology in order to stay relevant and ahead of near-peer militaries in spending (particularly <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/05/65019/china-us-ai-military-spending/">China</a>).</p>
