<p><em>Disclosure: My next job after graduating from Kellogg will be working as a product manager at the Department of Defense’s new epicenter for artificial intelligence, <a href="www.ai.mil">the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC)</a>.</em></p>

<hr />
<p>The United States Department of Defense (DoD) intends to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to both transform its business processes as well as the application of force on the battlefield. The last two presidents have directed the DoD to shift focus from counter-insurgency operations to <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2107397/near-peer-threats-at-highest-point-since-cold-war-dod-official-says/">near-peer competition</a>. DoD is investing in AI technology in order to stay relevant and ahead of near-peer militaries in spending (particularly <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/05/65019/china-us-ai-military-spending/">China</a>).</p>
<p>Statement about the future of AI goes here!</p>

<h2>Ethics Principles</h2>
<p>In 2019, the Defense Innovation Board (DIB) released, and the DoD subsequently adopted, the <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/31/2002204458/-1/-1/0/DIB_AI_PRINCIPLES_PRIMARY_DOCUMENT.PDF">following principles</a> for the ethical use of AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsible</li>
<li>Equitable</li>
<li>Traceable</li>
<li>Reliable</li>
<li>Governable</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These principles clearly were informed by the consensus forming around Principled AI. The Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2020/principled-ai">conducted an analysis</a> of the various sets of AI principles released over the last 5+ years and showed the prevalence of eight key themes for principled AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Safety and Security</li>
<li>Transparency and Explainability</li>
<li>Fairness and non-discrimination</li>
<li>Human control of technology</li>
<li>Professional Responsibility</li>
<li>Promotion of Human Values</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that the DoD’s AI principles are “aligned with DoD’s mission to deter war and protect our nation. Further, these principles are consistent with existing policy frameworks, the Law of War, domestic law, such as Title 10 of the U.S. Code, and enduring ethical norms that reflect democratic values.” <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is fair to say that in fact, due to its position as an organ of government, DoD must implement AI to a higher ethical standard than companies in the private sector, which are less restricted by policy. While this higher standard has the purpose of ensuring all DoD AI applications maintain an ethical standing, it also implies that AI in the Department will evolve at a slower pace than in the private sector, due to increased friction. Moving forward, it will be imperative for DoD to maintain connections with the private sector innovators in AI in order to keep pace.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The environment for development of AI technology has only developed in the last decade with the proliferation of cloud services, providing both the engine (distributed computing) and fuel (data) for AI algorithms:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-06-02-ai-defense_files/statistic_id273818_public-cloud-services_-market-size-2009-2022.png" /></p>
<p>The DoD’s <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2019/Feb/04/2002085866/-1/-1/1/DOD-CLOUD-STRATEGY.PDF">cloud strategy</a> (as of 2018) stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has multiple disjointed and stove-piped information systems distributed across modern and legacy infrastructure around the globe leading to a litany of problems that impact warfighters’, decision makers’, and DoD staff’s ability to organize, analyze, secure, scale, and ultimately, capitalize on critical information to make timely, data-driven decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DoD has not kept up with the private sector in building up infrastracture that seeds AI capabilities. This is set to change over the next few years, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Enterprise_Defense_Infrastructure">Project JEDI</a>, once it clears litigation from Amazon and other cloud providers, is designed to bring all DoD IT systems onto a single cloud-based structure. JEDI will put both data storage and distributed compute resources at the fingertips of users across the DoD.</p>
<p>The JAIC’s <a href="https://www.ai.mil/blog_03_25_20-developing_the_jcf_dhodges.html">Joint Common Foundation (JCF)</a> will build on this cloud infrastructure to “provide the development, test, and runtime environment and the collaboration, tools, reusable assets, and data that military services need to build, refine, test, and field AI applications.” <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The JCF will reduce technical barriers to AI adoption, create standardized tools for AI development, and encourage efficiencies by finding repeatable and scalable processes for AI development within DoD.</p>
<p>Project JEDI, and the JCF layered on top of it<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, set the conditions for DoD to rapidly develop AI solutions across the Department. Up until now, AI procurement has been through the traditional contracting process to outside firms. Soon, AI will be produced by users for users, bringing DoD up to speed rapidly.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>in the last few weeks, it has become clear that the JCF will instead be layered on top of a different cloud from the Air Force called <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2020/05/joint-ai-center-turns-to-air-force-cloudone-as-jedi-stalls/">CloudONE</a>. The benefits will be the same, and ultimately the JCF will be transitioned to JEDI after the litigation is resolved.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
