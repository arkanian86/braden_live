<h3>A tool for bidding on your classes</h3>
<p><a href="https://bradenlive.shinyapps.io/bid_tce_vis_tool/">BidVis</a> is an app I built that takes data provided by the Kellogg academic advising department and turns it into useful visualizations.</p>

<p>The two datasets are the Course and Teacher Evaluations (CTECs) as well as the Kellogg course bidding statistics. At Kellogg, every student is allotted a certain number of bid points which they then allocate to the various classes they’d like to take. Students are awarded a seat in the class if they bid highly enough (higher than their peers).</p>
<p>BidVis provides useful visualizations, sorting capabilities, and more. It is much more flexible and easy to use than the status quo solution for students before, which was downloading <code>.csv</code> files from the Kellogg website and then manipulating the actual data in Excel. If students get a view they like in Bidvis, they can always download the particular dataset they’ve created using the <code>download filtered data</code> button.</p>
<p>Writing this app was really fun - I learned a lot about how to clean a dataset to make it ready for production, as well as the ins and outs of hosting a web app using Rshiny.</p>
<p>If you’d like to test out the app to see what I built, feel free. <a href="https://bradenlive.shinyapps.io/bid_tce_vis_tool/">BidVis</a> can be accessed with the username “<strong>2y_2020</strong>” and password “<strong>braveleaders</strong>”.</p>
