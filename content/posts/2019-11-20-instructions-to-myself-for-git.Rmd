##Git commands I should know

This post is a collection of commands that I would like to remember and keep track of to help me in building new posts, using Github/RStudio/Terminal/Netlify, and generally make my life easier.

<!--more-->

1. `git add .`
- use this to add all files in the current directory
2. `git add netlify.toml`
- use this to update the `netlify.toml` file
3. `git commit -m "some comments"`
- names the commit I think?
4. `git push origin master`
- pushes the files to the remote directory
5. `git push -f origin master`
- if I made changes remotely (i.e. on Github directly) this will overwrite all of them

#Blogdown commands I should know for new content

1. `blogdown::build_site()`
2. `blogdown::serve_site()`
