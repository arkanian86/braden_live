<p>At first, I thought the Cybertruck rolling onto the stage was a joke.</p>
<p>It became (very) painfully real that the vehicle behind Elon Musk was not a joke, as he and his henchmen decided to punish the truck with sledgehammers and gigantic metal ball bearings - awkwardly resulting in an “OMFG” from Musk when his assistant actually shattered two windows in an apparent stress test gone horribly wrong.</p>
<p>Awarkwardness aside, when the reveal event mercifully ended I was left with one major question: who does Elon Musk think is going to buy this thing?</p>
