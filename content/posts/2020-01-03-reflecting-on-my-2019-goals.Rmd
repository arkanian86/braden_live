I've never been one for New Year's Resolutions. I always thought the entire process was artificial -- why make resolutions based upon arbitrary number from the calendar?

I held this view up until last year, when my wife convinced me to come along with her for her "end of year reflection"...a few hours at our local coffee shop ([Colectivo](https://colectivocoffee.com/cafes/evanston) in Evanston, if you're wondering). We spent the time thinking about everything that happened in the past year (2018) including a Navy deployment for me, medical issues for her, and starting school at Kellogg. Each of us also thought about how we wanted to shape the coming year, and wrote down our goals. It was a useful exercise -- we repeated it this year.

Looking back at what I wrote a year ago has been illuminating.
