<p>Over the last few weeks, the Coronavirus, more properly known as COVID-19, has been on my mind more than anything else. I follow several tech people on Twitter who were early voices sounding the alarm on COVID-19 - primarily <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">Balaji Srinivasan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD">Scott Gottlieb</a>. Normally, Iâ€™m fairly conservative and skeptical of warnings like these. Fortunately, however, Balaji, Scott, and others convinced me through their in-depth and informative tweets that COVID-19 was going to be a serious crisis in just a matter of a few weeks. My wife and I took a trip to Costco to stock up on non-perishables like peanut butter and toilet paper (the essentials) and were able to avoid the rush that has been increasing as the public has become more fearful and hoarding.</p>
